# What is PrediFi?

Predifi is a decentralized prediction protocol built on Starknet. It enables users to predict future outcomes across various global events; including sports, crypto, politics, crypto, pop-culture, finance and many more!

Predictions and their results are immutable and verifiable "onchain" on the Starknet blockchain, enabling P2P predictions (challenge pools) and eliminating the need for a third party. This innovative approach provides a transparent, fun and rewarding way to foster interaction within communities while monetizing the buzz and excitement surrounding trending topics and events.


## Quick Overview

- On PrediFi you can buy and sell shares representing outcomes on future events (e.g "will Elon Musk send a probe to Mars this year?")

- Each participant buys shares based on their confidence in the predicted outcome, the precision of these predictions adds excitement
and increases the potential rewards.

- Reward distribution initiates following the conclusion of events, the platform's
community validators verify the outcome.
For major events, if reliable data is available
online, that data is used to select the winner, if not the community validators will determine the correct outcome, participants who made accurate predictions will receive their rewards 
Tbe staked tokens are distributed based on those who guessed correctly and the amount of shares held in the pool.

- Pool creators earn a fixed percentage of the total pool funds (e.g 5%); pool creators not only spark engaging discussions but also generate a unique revenue stream, transforming the excitement of an important event into a profitable endeavor.


## Features [types of prediction pools]

▪︎ Win Bet (main pool type)

The Win Bet is a straightforward prediction pool where participants choose between two
clear outcomes. This format is ideal for events with definitive winners, such as sports
matches, political elections, or game show outcomes. Win Bet establishes a clear and simple entry point for users, making it the cornerstone of PrediFi’s prediction markets.
Example use case:
- predict the winner of the FIFA World Cup final: Team A vs. Team B.
- predict the outcome of a boxing match: Fighter A vs. Fighter B.

▪︎ Opinion-Based Prediction [bet on vote]
(secondary pool type)

This pool format focuses on opinion-based events where there isn’t a definitive answer, instead participants place bets on subjective topics, the outcome with the most votes at the
end of the event wins. Fosters engagement by involving communities in fun and subjective debates.
Example use case:
- "who is the GOAT of football; Messi or Ronaldo?"
- "which song will top the charts this week; Song A or Song B?".

This type of pool is excellent for driving engagement in pop culture debates and viral trends. However, because it’s based on collective opinion, it is more about gauging popularity than predicting factual outcomes.


## Future Features [proposed pool types]

### Over/Under Pools

In Over/Under pools, participants bet on whether an event's outcome will be above or below
a specified threshold. An example use case is predicting the total goals in a football match.

here's how it works:
- with Over 2.5 goals, you win if the total goals scored is 3 or more (e.g 2-1 or 3-2)
- with Under 2.5 goals, you win if the total goals scored is 2 or fewer (e.g 0-0 or 1-1).
The .5 means that 2.5 isn't a possible score, clarifying the bet, this format is great for statistical predictions.

### Parlay Pools

Parlay pools combine multiple bets into one, participants must correctly predict the
outcomes of all events in the parlay to win.
While the risk is higher, the potential rewards are
significantly greater.
Example use case:
- predict the outcomes of multiple football matches in a single pool: Team A, Team C, and
Team E all to win.
- combine predictions from different events: predict the winner of a basketball match and the
top scorer in a tennis match. This feature is ideal for high-stakes participants who enjoy betting across multiple events for larger payouts.
